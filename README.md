A 2D dungeon crawler created as an entry to the 2020 Global Game Jam. Play as Cecil, the penguin janitor tasked with cleaning and resetting the dungeon after the destruction caused by the latest hero’s attempt to clear the level. Be careful–the traps and monsters are just as deadly to you as they are to the heroes!

Built with Phaser3.
